# Exploratory-Analysis

In this particular project, we are intended to perform exploratory data analysis on NYC 311 Service Request dataset. Also, at the same time, we need to do necessary preprocessing on the data as well.

The analysis is done in two phases-
 ### ->First phase includes on-time redresal Vs overdue redresal analysis.
 ### ->Second phase include analysis irrespective of due date.
